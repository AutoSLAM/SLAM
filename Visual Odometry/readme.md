The following code deals with using the kinect for odometry.   

* get_c.m:  Can be run directly to get the calibration constant for visual odometry.
* get_common_features.m:  Can be run directly to view the common features between 2 images, as determined with the SURF algorithm.
* get_odometry_map.m:   Can be run directly to obtain the path which a kinect moves along (assumes the path to be along a flat plane).
* SLAM_bot.m:  Can be done directly to run a SLAM bot, assuming the Arduino code provided in the interfacing folder is loaded onto the Arduino.
